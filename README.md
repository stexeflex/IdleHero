# IDLE HERO

Idle Hero is a little idle game that started as a side project to combine my interest in incremental games and action RPGs.
Additionally, it serves as a playground for me to experiment with Angular and AI-based software development.

## Gameplay

The core gameplay loop is based on incremental progression, where your hero grows over time.
Visit dungeons and defeat bosses to earn experience and other rewards, which can be used to improve your hero and tackle tougher challenges.
Level up different attributes and improve your crafted gear with various enchantments to further enhance your hero's power.
